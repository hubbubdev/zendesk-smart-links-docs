To reference them via a Smart Link, copy the value of the `Field ID` column, and we'll use that in our smart link like so: `{{ticket.customField:custom_field_35588134477723}}`  \n \n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ff26ecc-eee3-4160-bc1f-97986929ac03)  \n \n## Pricing  \n \nGet started for Free with 2 dynamic links!
