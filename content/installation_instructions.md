Click **Add Link** and enter a label for the link (that will be shown to your agents)

When entering the URL, you can specify variables from the Zendesk instance using double curly braces such as `{{ticket.id}}`

Here are some examples for how you might want to leverage this:

`https://stripe.com/customers/{{ticket.requester.externalId}}`

`https://nice.com/schedule/{{currentUser.email}}`

`https://salesforce.com/contacts?q={{ticket.requester.email}}`

The **Insert Variable** button will also help you easily add common variables that you might want to use, however you are not limited to this list.
